# Czech Notes, The Basics 

LEGEND: 

`^` following a letter is a 'hachecked' (made up word) letter `hac^eck`

`*` following a letter is the sunshine symbol over o `tvu*j` 

`'` will follow letters like i with the apostropher `i'`

## Pronounciation, the gotchas 

of note in the realm of vowels are **dipthongs** or 'diphthongy' in czech, they are compunds of two vowels that act like a single sound.  

**OU**,
**AU**,
**EU**,
**IE**,
**IO**,
**AO**

**K**,**P** and **T** lack the typical English 'post-aspiration' (or air exale) unless they occur at the end of a word. 

**CH** is always 'ck' 

**R** is briefly trilled like a scottish 'r'


`C` is pronounced as `ts`

`J` is like `y` in `yes`

## some consonants that change 

Sometimes certain consonants will morph into their voiceless pair when shifted to the end of a word (there could be otheer conditions as well) 

in particular `v-f` and `b-p` if `b` becomes 'p' at the end of the word as in `fab` would be pronounced `fap` :-)

Typically one consonant becomes voiceless to match the next: 

as in `zuzksa` pronounced `zuska` as the `k` influences the preceding voicefull consonant. As you can see, there is a seemingly consistent hierarchy between letters in these words. 

Sometimes a voiced consonant will also influence the voiceless consonant that precedes it as in `kde` pronounced `gde` so the rule is more based on the letters' positions in this case than any trate of the letter itself.

An exception is that the voiced `v` has no effect on preceding consonants 

`tvuj` is not `dvuj`

v is an underdog 

## Nouns, genders

Most of the time you can determine the gender of a noun by the suffix. 

**Female**: 

`a`, `e`, or `ost`

**Male**:

most nouns ending in  any consonant 

**Neuter** 

most nouns ending in `o` or `i'`
